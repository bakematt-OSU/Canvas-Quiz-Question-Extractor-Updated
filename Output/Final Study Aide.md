Using the version of Dijkstra's Algorithm discussed in the lectures (see below), and the network configuration in the graph (see below), to calculate the shortest path from node B to node G.

(NOTE#1: A tie goes to the lower node, alphabetically (A before F).

What is the full shortest path from node B to node G? (e.g. for a path from H to D you would type "H-D" without quotes)

What is the cost of the shortest path from node B to node G?

Fill in the complete routing table for node B, as it would be calculated by Dijkstra's algorithm and stored inside router B. (It's OK to do this by inspection; you don't have to crank through Dijkstra's algorithm for each destination.)
